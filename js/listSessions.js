		"sessionSummary":"Building your next mobile app, SaaS product, or killer social network using an API first philosophy is a great decision. It can allow your team to develop in parallel, enable expansion to multiple platforms, and create opportunity for outside integration. But once you've made that decision, what's next? How do you actually do it? /n What options are there for authentication? How do you reset a password with an API? Is hypermedia worth considering for internal APIs? How do you handle unauthenticated access from a client side javascript application? What format is best for API requests and responses? Should you version your API now, or later? Let's talk about how you can determine the right answers for all those questions, and give your API a solid foundation. Because your API may start out serving the needs of internal mobile clients, or single page web apps, but one day (sooner than you think) you'll probably be turning it into a public API.",

This JavaScript-driven stack was sometimes sought as a means to abandon the more traditional LAMP stack. Even if LAMP and similar backends were retained, there was a general move toward decoupling the frontend from the backend. Things have changed quickly in 3 years. We'll discuss new technologies, as well as old, as well as common pitfalls encountered in frontend development, both past and present, and discuss solutions to overcome them.",

		"sessionSummary":"We all know that React works, but being functional implies so much more than the typical dictionary definition would imply. Using React  as an example, I’d like to walk you through some tenets of functional programming. As one of the few JavaScript view creation libraries that is completely Universal/Isomorphic, React gives us the opportunity to build applications that can run on the server and client very easily. Typically though, we are discussing the 'virtual DOM' and performance when talking about React. A win much bigger than the words ‘virtual DOM’ exists in React, and through my examples, you’ll see what makes reasoning about functional systems such a treat.",
