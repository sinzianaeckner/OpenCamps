It can allow your team to develop in parallel, enable expansion to multiple platforms, and create opportunity for outside integration. But once you've made that decision, what's next? How do you actually do it? /n What options are there for authentication? How do you reset a password with an API? Is hypermedia worth considering for internal APIs? How do you handle unauthenticated access from a client side javascript application? What format is best for API requests and responses? Should you version your API now, or later? Let's talk about how you can determine the right answers for all those questions, and give your API a solid foundation. Because your API may start out serving the needs of internal mobile clients, or single page web apps, but one day (sooner than you think) you'll probably be turning it into a public API.",

This JavaScript-driven stack was sometimes sought as a means to abandon the more traditional LAMP stack. Even if LAMP and similar backends were retained, there was a general move toward decoupling the frontend from the backend. Things have changed quickly in 3 years. We'll discuss new technologies, as well as old, as well as common pitfalls encountered in frontend development, both past and present, and discuss solutions to overcome them.",

Given the current climate of front-end JS frameworks you probably found that a few of the 293,113 npm packages suited your needs, but aren't sure which to choose because most things sound like they can all do the same thing. Maybe you sort them by the highest number of downloads to weed out the libraries with the least support, and then maybe you want to make sure anything left has great tooling and community-built packages that will give your small team a leg up when necessary.<br><br>You almost certainly landed in between the three largest frameworks/libraries in the JS community: Angular, Ember, and React. I, personally, cried myself to sleep with huge tears of regret after I realized I chose the wrong one and would have to spend months dealing with such a decision...Don\'t follow in my footsteps!<br><br>This talk is going to examine the three major players in the JavaScript community and try to elucidate their similarities, but more important their salient differences. We will talk about their technical differences while taking into accound the practical reality of web development. We'll also create pretend gladiator situations out of your developer woes and see which dies first. Because this is JSPARTA!",

What if we could endow autonomous robots each with a Society of Mind, and what if we could entangle these minds into a society of robots? Thanks to Nerves, Elixir runs comfortably on the EV3 brick, which makes it surprisingly easy to implement Minsky's concept using inexpensive Lego robots. We will discuss the concept of Society of Mind, our interpretation of it and its implementation for Lego robots. We will explore how agents are used to generate and orchestrate perceptions, motivation, intents and behaviors. We will demonstrate how robots can form peer-to-peer networks over which they share perceptions for better (collaboration) or for worse (group panic).",

		"sessionSummary":"We all know that React works, but being functional implies so much more than the typical dictionary definition would imply. Using React  as an example, I’d like to walk you through some tenets of functional programming. As one of the few JavaScript view creation libraries that is completely Universal/Isomorphic, React gives us the opportunity to build applications that can run on the server and client very easily. Typically though, we are discussing the 'virtual DOM' and performance when talking about React. A win much bigger than the words ‘virtual DOM’ exists in React, and through my examples, you’ll see what makes reasoning about functional systems such a treat.",

Well, luckily your answer to handling this is A/B testing to see before rolling out a full-fledged platform change.",
