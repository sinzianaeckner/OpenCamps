		"sessionSubTitle":"Keynote",
		"sessionSummary":"<p>Soon after the notable performance of IBM’s Watson on Jeopardy, I laid out the skeleton of a new computing paradigm which IBM later dubbed “Cognitive Computing”. Over the five years since then, cognitive computing is indeed proving to be a radical shift in software and information technology, that disrupts previously understood terms like “performance”, “feature”, “debugging”, and even “truth”. In this talk I will give a personal perspective on how cognitive computing has progressed, and is re-shaping the roles that computer systems play in our lives and our cultural awareness, touching on such themes as digital culture, multilinguality, multilingual access, discovery and metadata quality.  I will focus specifically on the role big data and human intelligence have in measuring quality of cognitive computing systems.</p>",

His main area of interest is using structured semantic information to improve semantic processing of unstructured information, such as using freebase to help improve web search. His latest work is on using crowdsourcing to form a new theory of truth based on diversity of perspectives. Before Google, Dr. Welty was a member of the technical leadership team for IBM's Watson - the question answering computer that destroyed the all-time best Jeopardy! champions in a widely televised contest. He appeared on the broadcast, discussing the technology behind Watson, as well as many articles in the popular and scientific press. His proudest moment was being interviewed for StarTrek.com about the project. He is a recipient of the AAAI Feigenbaum Prize for his work. Welty was one of the first to call attention to the new paradigm of Cognitive Computing that is emerging in computation, and previously has played a seminal role in the development of the Semantic Web and Ontologies, and co-developed OntoClean, the first formal methodology for evaluating ontologies.

As the people that build these systems, we have a social responsibility to consider how these systems affect people, and furthermore, we should do whatever we can to prevent these systems and models from perpetuating some of the prejudice and bias that exist in our society today.  In this talk I will cover some recommendation systems that have gone wrong across various industries, and attempt to provide some solutions for prevention. First and foremost among these is promoting awareness, but approaches involving interpretable models, using ensemble models to separate features that shouldn't interact, and designing test data sets for capturing bias will also be explored.</p>",

Specifically, we are interested in extracting biological information from higher moments. In this talk, I will describe some of my lab’s work with respect to gene expression variability and investigating the prevalence of non-Normal expression distributions in different tumor types. The goal of my talk is to illustrate some of the areas and questions in bioinformatics where the use of more sophisticated data science methods, including machine learning applications can yield interesting insights into biology that may have been missed by standard approaches.</p>",

And that can take away valuable time and effort from focusing on what matters to our customers -- the front-end UX.   Enter Firebase. Firebase is a \"back-end as a service\" platform that works with a wide array of front-end technologies (web, Android, iOS) and has built-in support for these core requirements. And in 2016, it has evolved further to put growth, testing and monetization needs into the spotlight, allowing front-end developers to create modern, cross-platform apps and deploy them with minimal effort.</p>",

It can allow your team to develop in parallel, enable expansion to multiple platforms, and create opportunity for outside integration. But once you've made that decision, what's next? How do you actually do it? /n What options are there for authentication? How do you reset a password with an API? Is hypermedia worth considering for internal APIs? How do you handle unauthenticated access from a client side javascript application? What format is best for API requests and responses? Should you version your API now, or later? Let's talk about how you can determine the right answers for all those questions, and give your API a solid foundation. Because your API may start out serving the needs of internal mobile clients, or single page web apps, but one day (sooner than you think) you'll probably be turning it into a public API.</p>",

To create a sustainable business you need to be able to grow your own.</p><p>Growing your own means hiring smart, motivated people with all the right soft skills and investing in them for the long haul. In return for helping give them a career, expect that they'll reward you with loyalty, will care about helping to teach your newer staff, and will work together with a cohesive vision (having all been trained the same way).</p><p>Do you sell code or do you sell expertise? (Hint the code is GPL.) If you sell expertise you recognize that the true value of your business is the people on your team. Sure your contracts and brand could keep you going for a little while, maybe you could even sell them, but it's the people who have the true value. So invest in them to invest in your business.</p><p>Sure sure, agreed agreed, people, yes, empathy, values etc etc yes yes. But how do you actually train up a team of expert consultants? How long is this going to take? How are you possibly supposed to afford it? If you're bringing in these green developers, won't they break your clients' sites and destroy your reputation? Jody, doesn't it seem totally contradictory that you're obsessed with quality AND saying it's cool to bring these amateurs into the team? Wow, guess we should expect to be getting some rescue projects sliding off of Zivtech's roster soon! And won't these people you're training just quit and come work for us once they're skilled and we offer them more money? And wait do you seriously pay people to get training?</p><p>Great questions! ;) I've been growing my own for a long time and harvesting the many rewards. I'll answer all these questions, new ones that I think up, and then follow it all up by letting you ask your own which I will then also answer.</p><p>This session is intended for business owners, leaders and managers as well as those getting ready to make the leap. You'll leave this session thinking differently about your opportunities and (hopefully) inspired to grow your own team instead of trying to buy one on the market.</p>",

Unfortunately, many of the graphs we see today are poor graphs that confuse, mislead or deceive the reader.

We point out some of these graphical mistakes. In most cases very simple changes make the resulting graphs easier for the reader to understand. We end with some useful little-known graph forms that communicate the data more clearly than the everyday graphs that are more commonly used.</p>",

Existing declarative visualization languages allow users to construct static visualizations by mapping data values to visual properties. Unfortunately, a similar process does not yet exist for interactive visualizations. Instead, custom interaction design requires programming with event handling callbacks -- a complex and error-prone task. In this talk, Arvind will describe how to use reactive building blocks, offered natively in recent versions of Vega, to author interactive data graphics. With this approach, the complexity of event propagation and state changes is managed entirely by Vega. Users are now free to more quickly prototype and iterate on interactive designs, and more easily retarget them across mouse and touch input.</p>",

Many of the diet solutions are built around celebrity endorsements. Magazines show how a famous person like Beyonce lost weight and tell readers they can do it too.\n\nScientific research states that there are many important factors that influence healthy eating and weight loss beyond “what you eat.” Many variables contribute to a healthy eating lifestyle including what time you eat, where you get your food, how much do you eat and does the food consumed satisfy your individual nutritional needs.  With all of these variables to consider, modeling healthy eating gets complicated quickly.  \n\nA graph database is the best way to represent the science and the art of healthy eating.   Using an open source dataset from the US government, I show you how I built and use a graph to model real food behavior for over 7,000 people from 2 months old to age 80.  The graph is used to visualize patterns around when people eat, how people combine food to create meals, and how well people meet their nutritional requirements.  All of these patterns can be observed in the context of each person’s Body Mass Index (a measure of obesity) and other health statistics.  Visualizing this rich dataset as a graph is valuable and informative for anyone interested in his or her health.</p>",

		"sessionSubTitle":"",
		"sessionSummary":"<p>Wireframes and mockups often fail to demonstrate the actual experience of a product. More often than not, the final product doesn\'t look anything like the mockups that were approved. This happens because the final deliverables weren\'t tested and iterated on. Another reason is that static deliverables are hard for teammates who aren\'t designers to collaborate on. During this process the interaction design & animation is often neglected, making the experience very flat & static. So are there ways we can create designs quickly, collaborate with others and test out our application without disrupting the design process?</p><p>Enter the front-end prototype, a sample application in the browser where designers can create features based on user needs and validates them with the stakeholders/clients, developers and other designers. Speed is very important when prototyping and the tools we use need to be efficient enough to design in a short amount of time. The great thing about a front-end prototype is that you can iterate further once designs are concrete, making it a great UX deliverable to dev. Another benefit is that it\'s an artifact that others outside of the product team can see and interact with. By just creating a front-end prototype, it breaks down the silos and improves communication and collaboration.</p><p>Before I started prototyping, my deliverables were static mockups the dev often needed me to walk through to understand what's going on. We sometimes spent hours going each of the mockups which is inefficient and stopped us from actually building the designs. Sometimes close deadlines wouldn't allow for a design review session, which would put pressure on developers to make their own design decisions that might hurt the overall experience. But once I was able to produce front-end prototypes, it strengthen the dialog between me and the developers and also made it a great tool in selling solutions to clients. But the thing I found most helpful was being able to iterate quickly. Over time I've learned some front-end techniques that made it easier for me to design in code rather than Photoshop, Sketch and/or Illustrator. Being able to wireframe and design in browser made me a better designer and collaborator.</p><p>The audience will learn:<ul><li>Simple techniques to wireframe in the browser</li><li>The process of creating high fidelity prototype</li><li>How front-end prototypes can be use in production</li><li>How a prototype can improve collaboration & communication in a team</li></ul></p>",

What if we could endow autonomous robots each with a Society of Mind, and what if we could entangle these minds into a society of robots? Thanks to Nerves, Elixir runs comfortably on the EV3 brick, which makes it surprisingly easy to implement Minsky's concept using inexpensive Lego robots. We will discuss the concept of Society of Mind, our interpretation of it and its implementation for Lego robots. We will explore how agents are used to generate and orchestrate perceptions, motivation, intents and behaviors. We will demonstrate how robots can form peer-to-peer networks over which they share perceptions for better (collaboration) or for worse (group panic).</p>",

This talk should be interesting for anyone who enjoys discussions of web technology capable of operating at massive scale.</p><p><em>Abstract</em></p><p>Node is one of the world’s fastest growing and most exciting platforms. It now leads Github in number of contributions, and its popularity and feature list only continue to grow.</p><p>When we realized it was time to update the Homepage at eBay to something more modern, Node was a perfect fit. We knew the new Homepage would need to be faster, require reusable components, and show things like recommendation feeds, in addition to trending and popular items.</p><p>Node brings a giant ecosystem that is inherently open source with npm; which, increases collaboration and code sharing. We\'re able to learn and develop more quickly, including server startup in seconds vs minutes. Node is incredibly fast with handling a large number requests, and uses less resources than Java making it more easily scaled horizontally. It’s 2016 and this move to a more modern platform helps not only with all the reasons above, but also with developer satisfaction and not to mention, recruiting.</p> <p>To make this move, we are utilizing Marko and Marko Widgets for our server side and client side rendering, as well as Lasso for managing and bundling our assets. We are also making the jump to ES6, natively on the backend and transpiled for the client side.</p> <p>This talk will include specific issues that were solved and how, the tooling and technologies used, and what\'s next.

Which you can edit files locally and they will automatically be pushed to your VM through shared folders with no delay.</p><p>When you\'re done working for the day, simply type $vagrant halt to suspend your VM and type in $vagrant up to resume it. The procedure was used successfully to deploy virtual machines to a group students at a workshop to teach women how to code their first database driven website using Ruby on Rails in New York in May 2016. Where I was an teaching a class of advanced students.</p>",
